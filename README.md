# MFI - Measure of Feature Importance. 

`MFI` is an algorithm that can explain the classifier in two ways:

1. model-based explanation: what has the classifier learned in total?

2. instance-based explanation: Given a specific data point (instance), which are the important features of this data point that drive the classifier prediction?
